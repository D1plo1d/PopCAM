# Tape positions. The actual coordinates and rotations of each tape is taken
# care of in the tape_group section of the jig configuration. Every value from
# the tape_group can also be optionally overriden here.
# Strips should be positioned with the components closer to the pin bed (and
# their feeder holes further from the pin bed). If you have components that
# need to be oriented in the other direction set inverted to true.
